### Bjarne Stroustrup PPP

Drills and Exercises from Bjarne Stroustrup's book:
## Programming Principles and Practice using C++, 3rd Edition

### Note
All programs in this repository were compiled and run using the c++23 standard, and flags as shown below:

``` g++ -std=c++23 -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic <name-of-program.cpp> -o <name-of-executable> && ./<name-of-executable> ```

A consequence of this is that some portions of the code have to modified so as to avoid all warnings from the compiler.
This is deliberately done so as to develop and adhere to 'best practices' and the habit of following good coding style.

This repository is simply just for
1. Documentating my journey through Bjarne Stroustrup's book. It doesn't claim to have the solution to all the exercises (even though I am very close to that, but the objective is not to solve all the exercises in the book, rather, it is to learn everything I possibly can learn from the book).
2. To provide support for others who may be having challenges with the exercises in the book. And it is on this basis that I am open to any contribution.

### Contributions
For anyone who is also working through the textbook themselves and has questions about any particular exercise solution, either why something works or if you've found a bug I've missed, feel free to open an issue.

If you also have an idea on a better implementation of any of the solutions, feel free to open an issue.

I look forward to the opportunity for discussion.
